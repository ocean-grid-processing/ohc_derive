"""Step 5 (collapse) and step 6 (combine).

Step 5 — collapse. Per constituent, per quantity, split the `realization` axis:
    value = the quantity at realization 0 (the mean field)
    sd    = standard deviation (ddof=1) across the member realizations, or None if mean-only

    collapse_sd({tag: {q: DataArray(realization, ...)}}) -> {tag: {q: {"value":..., "sd":...}}}

Step 6 — combine. Fold the constituents into the synthetic level:
    value(q) = sum_i n_fac_i * value_i(q)
    sd(q)    = sum_i n_fac_i * sd_i(q)      worst-case, summed after the collapse
into one dataset per level: each `q` and `q_sd`, plus the footprint area/volume (both from the mask
step) and the physical constants as attributes. Packaging turns the extensive quantities into per-area
densities from these.

A masked constituent carries NaN below its first gap (contiguous_from_top), meaning "contributes
nothing here". The integrated quantities lost those NaNs one step earlier, in `map_transforms.integral`'s
skipna spatial sum, so by the combine they are gap-free series and a plain sum is exact. A quantity that
keeps the grid (carries lat/lon) never passes through that reduction, so its per-constituent NaNs are
still live here: a plain sum would propagate them and collapse the footprint to the constituent
intersection. Those quantities combine nan-aware instead — a missing constituent counts as 0, and a cell
is NaN only where every constituent is absent — so the gridded footprint is the same union the integral
already sums over.
